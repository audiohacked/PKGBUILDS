# ArchLinux PKGBUILDs for craftbukkit and CMaNGOS

This Repository is for the PKGBUILDs to build C(ontinued)-MaNGOS server and install the databases.
You can visit the Upstream Code at [CMaNGOS](https://github.com/cmangos).

*NOTE*: the only packages that currently work are cmangos-cata-git and cmangos-wotlk-git!

CraftBukkit is a Minecraft Mod Server. [Bukkit](https://bukkit.org/) is the place to get the server and plugins.
These packages are modified from the AUR versions in that you can run multiple versions of the Server concurrently.

Craftbukkit-1.7.2 only exists because my first install was version 1.7.2 and I use it for my data and plugins that 
only support version 1.7.2.
